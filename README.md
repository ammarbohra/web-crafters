# Web Crafters

### Web Crafters was a technical event that took place in Renaissance 2022. Renaissance is a fest held every year and hosted by JECRC Foundation.

The task was to create a login form in short duration of time from scratch.
We created a form that took inspiration from google's material design. We create the input's used by google from scratch. We added validation to the form. To improve the design we took the card approach as well as added some gradients.
